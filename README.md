# ApartmentFinder
Used Beautiful Soup to scrape through https://www.buyrentkenya.com/ to find particular apartments that meet a certain criteria. 
Transferred the address of the property, the price per month and the link to property to a form. The program does this for all the properties. Creating a new
response each time. Used selenium to autofill the form. Created a spreadsheet from the responses with the address of the property, the price per month, 
and a link to the property.
